### Enhancements

## 1.2.0 (2016-07-22)

Minor release addressing the following:

### Enhancements

* Added Android N Developer Preview 5 support (earlier only available by building from master).
* Added an easier to access button to stop using a device from the control screen. Thanks [@miss0110](https://github.com/miss0110)!
* Updated the official Docker image to Ubuntu 16.04 and Node v6.3.0.
* Added a `--no-cleanup` option to disable the default behavior of apps getting cleaned up automatically when a user stops using the device.
* Added ESLint rules for easily checking pull requests.
* Added a Slack notifier unit.
* Added an `stf doctor` command to check and output external dependencies. Very useful for issues.
* Added an OpenID auth unit. Thanks [@codeskyblue](https://github.com/codeskyblue)!
* Added optional HTTP Basic auth to the mock auth unit, for when you can't set up a proper auth adapter but still want at least a tiny bit of added security.
* Considerably smaller and up to date official [Docker image for armv7l](https://hub.docker.com/r/openstf/stf-armv7l/) with automated nightly builds on [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/). May occasionally break for a while but we aim to always keep it fully up to date.
* Added instructions for using [Google OAuth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2) login to the deployment guide, making it possible to sign in using your Google account.
* Added a configurable username field to the LDAP auth unit. Thanks [@bananayong](https://github.com/bananayong)!
* Updated and added various translations.

### Fixes

* Fixed screen area not being visible in latest versions of Chrome.
* Fixed Meizu Note 2 and similar devices which did not work due to non-standard output.
* Fixed ports getting leaked causing the provider unit to completely run out of ports if devices die a lot. Thanks [@skyline-gleb](https://github.com/skyline-gleb)!
